Welcome to the official repository for **Frontline: Blacksite**! Primary development of **Frontline: Blacksite** happens in C# with **.NET 10** as our target. Some small parts of the game may be written in other languages as needed, or when C# does not fit the bill (most often you will see Python). This repo is licensed under a special **source-available** license that can be read [right here](./LICENSE).

We also allow and accept community contributions! More information about how you can contribute, or how your contributions will be used in the project itself, can all be found [in this helpful file](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

This is a modern repo, so we use modern features such as CI/CD and a lot of GitHub-specific markdown rendering, so it's recommended that you read our docs *on the GitHub site* or in a markdown renderer, not as plain text!

## What *is* Frontline: Blacksite?

**Frontline: Blacksite** is a class-based multiplayer FPS built around tight gunplay, expressive movement, and readable team roles.

Matches are small, focused, and objective-driven. Typically 6v6 with an emphasis on positioning, and teamwork rather than loadout complexity or ability spam. There are no hero ultimates, no perk trees, and no choice paralysis: what matters is teamplay, tactics, and mechanics.

The game takes inspiration from classic Valve-era shooters, combining:
- The accessibility and clarity of Team Fortress–style class design  
- The precision and responsiveness of peak Counter-Strike gunplay  
- Smooth, momentum-driven movement inspired by Source-engine games  

All combat takes place in off-the-books conflict zones: *blacksites*, where deniable forces clash over territory, objectives, and control. These fights aren’t public. They aren’t sanctioned. And they don’t leave witnesses.

**Frontline: Blacksite** is designed to be played, learned, and mastered over time. Whether on official servers or community-run ones, without aggressive monetization or live-service pressure. The only cost to *you* should be the cost of entry. Everything else is purely optional and cosmetic.

## When will this be on Steam?

Soon! Right now we're in the process of joining the Steamworks Partner Program and getting all the important documents straight with Valve, the IRS & CRA before opening up a Steam Store page with our game and its art/content. It may take a couple months while certain required content (such as art, a game trailer and gameplay footage) set up for our Steam Store page!

Right now, resources for artists are slim and the head developer is also a university student. A time for the Store Page to be open is not yet known, but it can be safely assumed that there should be a presence by June 2026. This will be updated periodically as needed to reflect events that may push back or pull forward the time of Store reveal.

## Will you release full builds on GitHub?

No, and this is intentional.

Public builds derived from this repository may have certain systems disabled or stubbed out. This includes functionality that depends on private infrastructure, trust assumptions, or services that are not safe to redistribute publicly. Examples include: Digital Rights Management, Anti-Cheat, and the Item Economy (when implemented)

These builds are intended for development, testing, and experimentation. While bug reports and reproducible issues are welcome, public builds should not be treated as representative of the live Steam release.
