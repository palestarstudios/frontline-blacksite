Welcome to the official repository for **Frontline: Blacksite**! Here is where most of the development happens. Primary development of **Frontline: Blacksite** happens in C# with **.NET 10** as our target. Some small parts of the game may be written in other languages as needed, or when C# does not fit the bill. This repo is licensed under a special **source-available** license that can be read [right here](./LICENSE).

We also allow and accept community contributions! More information about how you can contribute, or how your contributions will be used in the project itself, [in this helpful file](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

This is a modern repo, so we use modern features such as CI/CD and a lot of GitHub-specific markdown rendering, so it's recommended that you read our docs *on the site* or in a markdown renderer, not as plain text!

## What *is* Frontline: Blacksite?

> [!NOTE]
> Epic and cool explanation of what this game is and why people should definintely spend C$21.99 + taxes to play it forever

## When will this be on Steam?

Soon! Right now we're in the process of joining the Steamworks Partner Program and getting all the important finance/tax documents straight with Valve, the Internal Revenue Service and Canada Revenue Agency before opening up a Steam Store page with our game and its art/content. It may take a couple months while certain required content for our Steam Store set up!

## Will you release full builds on GitHub?

No — and this is intentional.

Public builds derived from this repository may have certain systems disabled or stubbed out. This includes functionality that depends on private infrastructure, trust assumptions, or services that are not safe to redistribute publicly.

These builds are intended for development, testing, and experimentation. While bug reports and reproducible issues are welcome, public builds should not be treated as representative of the live Steam release.
