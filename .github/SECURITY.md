# Security Policy

The Frontline: Blacksite team takes security and player safety seriously. We appreciate responsible disclosure and cooperation from the community.

This repository contains **development-facing code and builds**. Some systems are intentionally disabled or incomplete and should not be treated as representative of the live Steam release.

> [!CAUTION]
> If security issues are found in the live build (the builds we push to Steam), this policy should apply and you should contact the studio at `palestarstudios@protonmail.com` ASAP.

## Supported Scope

We welcome responsible security reports related to:

* Crashes or stability issues triggered by malformed input
* Clearly exploitable behavior in development builds
* Vulnerabilities in tooling or build infrastructure within this repository

Reports should be limited to **reproducible, technical issues**.

---

## Out of Scope

The following are considered out of scope and may be closed without response:

* Issues resulting from intentionally disabled or stubbed systems
* Hypothetical or speculative vulnerabilities
* Denial-of-service scenarios requiring unrealistic resources
* Attacks against private or internal infrastructure
* Reverse engineering of the live Steam release
* Balance, economy, or gameplay concerns

---

## Responsible Disclosure

If you believe you have found a security issue:

1. **Do not** publicly disclose the issue or open a public issue.
2. Contact us privately with a clear description of the problem.
3. Include reproduction steps, affected commits or builds, and any relevant logs.

You may contact the team at:

`palestarstudtios@protonmail.com`

The subject line should contain `SECURITY` first and foremost. Most other emails sent to this address will be ignored and deleted. Average response time to a security issue is approximately one week. (5-7 days)

## Disclosure Expectations

* We will acknowledge receipt of valid reports.
* We will investigate in good faith.
* We may request additional information or clarification.
* We do not offer monetary rewards at this time.

Please allow reasonable time for investigation before any disclosure.

## Legal

By submitting a report, you agree that:

* You will not exploit the issue beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it.
* You will not violate applicable laws or regulations.
* You will act in good faith to protect players and the community.
* You may be credited for submitting a disclosure in patches of the live build.
